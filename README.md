# Testing Classes in Ruby

Build a solution to the Airport Challenge, to learn about TDDing classes in Ruby.

## User Stories

```
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
```

## Instructions

This repository already has some code and passing tests for Plane. However an Airport class hasn't yet been implemented, and there are only some tests.

Your task is to:

1. Use TDD to pass the current tests

2. Finish writing the incomplete tests, then use TDD to write the code

3. Add in tests to check that the capacity of the airport can be changed, then use TDD to pass those tests
